          Vaxin Pass will allow people to return to offices, stadium, airline
          flights, restaurants, etc. easily without having to pull different
          documents in different countries and regions at checkpoints to verify
          the proof of vaccination. The health organization will generate and
          provide the individual with unique QR (Quick Response) code after
          getting vaccinated. The person then can scan the QR code or manually
          add it to digital wallet/app on their phone. This QR code can then be
          simply pulled up on the phone and presented for scanning to verifying
          authorities to check the vaccine status. Thus, with Vaxin pass people
          can return to normal allowing people to maintain control of their
          privacy and share it the way that is easy, safe, secure, and
          verifiable.
